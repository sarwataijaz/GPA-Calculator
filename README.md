## GPA CALCULATOR USING ANDROID STUDIO
This app features a single activity for efficient GPA calculation, allowing users to select credit hours and grades. With easy navigation using '+' and '-' buttons, the number of courses can be adjusted seamlessly. While initially practicing data structure concepts like stacks, I implemented a straightforward logic that could have been achieved with a basic Kotlin mutable list. 
Im not much good with UI design so this very first project I made in android studio was for the practicing purpose. Although i planned on just implementing the logic and basic layouts just to enhance my learning and so i could get more familiar wih Android Studio, but gradually i started looking for more ways to make it look appealing enough as an actual app.
I changed the system design for both dark and light theme as the colors did not seem to match with dark theme.

# Things to work on:
- Heavy UI implementation is causing the application to respond longer than expected.
- The app keeps on crashing when we decrease the number of courses and reach to the single one and press the "calculate" button.
