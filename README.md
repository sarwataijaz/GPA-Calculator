## GPA CALCULATOR USING ANDROID STUDIO
This app features a single activity for efficient GPA calculation, allowing users to select credit hours and grades. With easy navigation using '+' and '-' buttons, the number of courses can be adjusted seamlessly. While initially practicing data structure concepts like stacks, I implemented a straightforward logic that could have been achieved with a basic Kotlin mutable list. 
Im not much good with UI design so this very first project I made in android studio was for the practicing purpose. Although i planned on just implementing the logic and basic layouts just to enhance my learning and so i could get more familiar wih Android Studio, but gradually i started looking for more ways to make it look appealing enough as an actual app.

I changed the system design for both dark and light theme to the ligher theme as the colors become a bit blurry in the dark mode.

I used linear layout for this as this was the only layout i learned about in the start. Made use of alot of Views like spinner, EditTexts, Buttons etc.
